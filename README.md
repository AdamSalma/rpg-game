An archive of my first ever project that gave me countless sleepless nights and an unhealthy addiction to programming. Enjoy!

Some of the game features:
- Battle elementals for gold + XP
- Travel into different biomes to collect different resources and items
- Craft items, smelt ores and harvest gemstones
- Weapons, armour and special abilities
- Village with a shop and quests
- Day clock with time events (e.g. stronger monsters at night)
